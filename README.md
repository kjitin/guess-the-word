# Code for creating a single player game against the computer
Unit tests show how the code will work, to implement it fully it will need to run in a while loop and should allow user to add the Letter to be guessed
from the standard input.
Currenlty all the responsibilities for the Game are handled by WordGuesser.java 
This can be refactored so that the responsibilites for Random Word Generation can be in a different class, responsibility
for handling user input from the standard input could be held in a different class.
